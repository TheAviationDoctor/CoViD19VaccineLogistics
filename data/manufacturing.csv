Pfizer,Pfizer,1. Raw material,Saint Louis,Missouri,United States of America,38.658831,-90.556371,#0078bc,"The St. Louis site is where the plasmid DNA for the vaccine antigen is produced. The DNA is the template required to manufacture the mRNA vaccine. The template DNA is produced in a cell culture process and subsequently purified through a series of chromatographic and filtration steps. The purified template DNA is then linearized in preparation for the manufacture of the mRNA drug substance at the Andover, MA, facility."
Pfizer,Pfizer,2. Drug substance,Andover,Massachusetts,United States of America,42.6147393,-71.1694422,#0078bc,"Using an enzymatic process, the Andover Manufacturing Facility is the site where the linearized template DNA is incubated with mRNA building blocks in a reaction vessel to make the mRNA drug substance. The mRNA drug substance is then purified to ensure it meets the highest level of quality and subsequently shipped to Kalamazoo."
Pfizer,Pfizer,"3. Formulation, Fill & Finish",Kalamazoo,Michigan,United States of America,42.2132505,-85.5583262,#0078bc,The Kalamazoo site will receive the mRNA drug substance and other raw materials and combine them through a series of steps including impingement jet mixing and specialized mixing to construct the lipid nano particle followed by sterile filtration. The bulk vaccine will then be transferred to an aseptic filling line where it will be filled into a sterilized vial and capped. It will then undergo 100% inspection before it is transferred to the packaging lines where it will be labeled and packed. The packed containers will then go into blast freezers before being staged in storage freezers awaiting final packing into dry ice shipping containers.

Pfizer,Pfizer,4. Distribution,Pleasant Prairie,Wisconsin,United States of America,42.5209573,-87.906455,#0078bc,"In the US, Pfizer's distribution approach will be to largely ship from the Kalamazoo, Michigan site direct to the point of use (POU). Pfizer also will use its existing distribution centers in Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin. Pfizer will be utilizing road and air modes of transportation in the United States, where Pfizer expects to be able to get product to any POU within a day or two."
